- Data visualization - creating charts and dashboards for performance trends
- Reporting - automated report generation for boat maintenance, crew performance, and event summaries

*   Goal Context: The Polars App is part of the Solent Platform microservices ecosystem, consuming data from the Event Service and other platform services to provide advanced analytics and business intelligence for boat and crew management.

## Success Metrics

*   Fast data processing performance (sub-second query response times for typical datasets)
*   Comprehensive analytics coverage (race performance, crew metrics, maintenance trends)
*   User adoption by boat managers and crew leaders
*   Integration reliability with other Solent Platform services
*   Data accuracy and insight quality as measured by user feedback
